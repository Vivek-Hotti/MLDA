## Machine Learning & Data Analysis Foundation with Python

### What is Learning:

- A machine is said to be learning if it learns from the data we feed in with respects to some class of tasks, and its performance at a given task improves with the experience.

- Types of Learning:
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Semi-supervised
4. Reinforcement

- Supervised Learning: Is when the model is getting trained on a labelled dataset. Labelled dataset is one which have both input and output paramenters.

Supervised learning can be divided into: 
a. Classification (defined fixed labels) - Discrete Data Set
b. Regression (no Labels defined) - Continous Data Set

- Unsupervised Learning: Type of learning when we don't give target to our model while training. The model has only imput parameter values. The model by itself has to find which way it can learn.

Unsupervised learning can be divided into: 
a. Clustering 
b. Association

- Semi-Supervised Learning: Mixture of both labelled and unlabelled datasets. For Unlabelled dataset we apply unsupervised learning & convert it into labelled data set. And then on the whole we use supervised learning.

- Reinforcement Learning: Keeps on increasing its performance using a Reward Feedback to learn the behavior or pattern. More it learns, the better it gets trained and hence experineced. 

### Data:

- Data is known as unprocessed facts and figures without any added interpretation or analysis.

- Types of data:

a. Nominal Data(Categorical) - Used for labelling variables without any quantitative value.

b. Ordinal Data - Quantities that have a natural ordering. Eg: Very Unhappy -> Unhappy -> Ok -> Happy -> Very Happy. Intervals split can't be presumed equal.

c. Interval Data - Is sam like ordinal except the intervals between values are equally split. Eg: 29-30 -> 30-31

d. Binary Data - Data can only be in two forms. Like Y or N or 1 or 0. 

e. Count Data - Total count of some class of data wherein various classes exist in a dataset.

f. Time Data - Cyclic data which repeats continuously.
